# KOSS Python classes
Introduction to Programming with Python (and basic Open Source Software Development principles)


Installation and Environment setup
----------------------------------

It is highly recommended for beginners to install Anaconda. If you don't want to use it, please have `jupyter notebook` installed (Python 3).

- Download and Install Anaconda (Installation page : https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
  - Windows : https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.3.1-Windows-x86_64.exe
  - Linux (Ubuntu) : https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
    - Run this script using `bash`. See the [installation page](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
  - macOS: https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.3.1-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg


If you do not have notebook or python setup in your compute
1. Go to https://notebooks.azure.com
1. Sign in, create a library
2. Create a new notebook in the library
3. In language, choose Python 3.6
4. Start the notebook!

Target students
---------------
The initial classes are aimed for beginners, people who do not have any programming experience as well as people who have basic knowledge of C/C++. If you already have tried Python before, the first few classes are not good for you (But you can come and help tutor :) !)
